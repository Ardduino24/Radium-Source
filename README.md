# Radium
The source code to my terribly made "Radium" exploit

<h1>Why I am posting the source code</h1>
I was the original author of this exploit. This was intended to be a private exploit, but I wanted to help some of my friends with their exploit, but however, one of my friends got ratted
by volxphy (the owner of the exploit named Cloudy) when I sent the src code in a gc (yeah, that was a retarded decision)

Now he is ofc known for bad reasons, but I'm not going to get into it (volxphy).

<h1>What this contains?</h1>
Well this exploit has somewhere around I'd say 20/30% unc, it contains a broken drawing lib, and some unc funcs

This was just a learners exploit, it wasn't meant for actual production, and it has tought me more about the Luau internals (more than I never knew before).

<h1>Extra notes</h1>
Tbh, idrc if anyone uses this, as it's already been leaked, but if anyone skids this, I'm not gonna say shit, I already know people will get on their asses for skidding this anyway. Not my problem really.
